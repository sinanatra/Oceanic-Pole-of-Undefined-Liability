A timeline visualising all the artificial space objects that fell within the South Pacific Ocean Uninhabited Area (SPOUA) from 1959 until now - reflecting on the past, present and future presence of space objects in marine environments.

By geolocating their predicted reentry, the resulting coordinates are juxtaposed with the legal limits of coastal statesâ€˜ sovereign rights, spanning from Exclusive Economic Zones to Navigational Areas.

While the first shows the conflicting intersection with the UN Law of the Sea and a possible breach thereof, the latter emphasises the constant risk of impact that re-entering spacecraft pose to shipping routes within the South Pacific Ocean.
