    <h2>Colophon</h2>
    <p>
        Since space exploration began in the 1950s, the various technologies
        used for launching and carrying out missions have left their mark,
        gradually creating vast fields and layers of debris both in orbit and in
        the Earth's marine environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        While space debris is mainly associated with the countless pieces
        scattered around the Earth, its re-entry into the atmosphere and its
        possible re-entry into the sometimes deliberately controlled marine
        environment often goes unnoticed. Media portraits deal with the
        phenomenon of falling debris mainly in the context of the mysterious <em
            >Point Nemo</em
        >, also known as the <em>spaceship graveyard</em>. However, the romantic
        and antropomorphic concept of technology finding its final resting place
        is misleading and ignores the reality of a chaotic waste dump 4 embedded
        in a complex legal dilemma around environmental damage.

    <h2>Map</h2>

        A timeline visualising all the artificial space objects that fell within
        the South Pacific Ocean Uninhabited Area (SPOUA) from 1959 until now -
        reflecting on the past, present and future presence of space objects in
        marine environments.

        By geolocating their predicted reentry, the resulting coordinates are
        juxtaposed with the legal limits of coastal statesâ€˜ sovereign rights,
        spanning from Exclusive Economic Zones to Navigational Areas.

        While the first shows the conflicting intersection with the UN Law of
        the Sea and a possible breach thereof, the latter emphasises the
        constant risk of impact that re-entering spacecraft pose to shipping
        routes within the South Pacific Ocean.
